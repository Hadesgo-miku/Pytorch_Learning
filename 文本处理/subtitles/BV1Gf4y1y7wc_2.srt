6.99 --> 10.24
You probably know that all stuff
is made up of atoms

10.27 --> 11.42
and that an atom

11.45 --> 15.17
is a really, really, really,
really tiny particle.

15.19 --> 16.6
Every atom has a core,

16.63 --> 18.15
which is made up of at least one

18.18 --> 19.52
positively charged particle

19.54 --> 21.14
called a proton,

21.17 --> 22.4
and in most cases,

22.42 --> 25.57
some number of neutral
particles called neutrons.

25.59 --> 26.94
That core is surrounded

26.97 --> 30.15
by negatively charged
particles called electrons.

30.79 --> 32.61
The identity of an atom is determined

32.64 --> 36.9
only by the number
of protons in its nucleus.

36.92 --> 39.67
Hydrogen is hydrogen because it
has just one proton,

39.7 --> 41.41
carbon is carbon because it has six,

41.44 --> 43.4
gold is gold because it has 79,

43.42 --> 44.68
and so on.

45.14 --> 47.13
Indulge me in a momentary tangent.

47.15 --> 49.49
How do we know about atomic structure?

49.52 --> 52.72
We can't see protons,
neutrons, or electrons.

53.81 --> 55.34
So, we do a bunch of experiments

55.36 --> 58.26
and develop a model
for what we think is there.

58.28 --> 59.81
Then we do some more experiments

59.83 --> 61.59
and see if they agree with the model.

61.62 --> 62.81
If they do, great.

62.84 --> 65.68
If they don't, it might
be time for a new model.

65.7 --> 68.34
We've had lots of very
different models for atoms

68.37 --> 70.49
since Democritus in 400 BC,

70.51 --> 71.99
and there will almost certainly

72.01 --> 73.58
be many more to come.

73.6 --> 75.45
Okay, tangent over.

75.47 --> 78.21
The cores of atoms tend to stick together,

78.23 --> 79.99
but electrons are free to move,

80.02 --> 82.77
and this is why chemists love electrons.

82.8 --> 84.21
If we could marry them,

84.23 --> 85.64
we probably would.

85.66 --> 86.96
But electrons are weird.

86.98 --> 89.53
They appear to behave either as particles,

89.55 --> 91.11
like little baseballs,

91.13 --> 93.3
or as waves, like water waves,

93.32 --> 96.5
depending on the experiment
that we perform.

96.52 --> 98.52
One of the weirdest things about electrons

98.55 --> 100.67
is that we can't exactly
say where they are.

100.7 --> 102.72
It's not that we don't have the equipment,

102.74 --> 104.12
it's that this uncertainty

104.14 --> 106.47
is part of our model of the electron.

106.5 --> 109.04
So, we can't pinpoint them, fine.

109.06 --> 111.73
But we can say
there's a certain probability

111.75 --> 113.72
of finding an electron in a given space

113.74 --> 115.68
around the nucleus.

115.7 --> 118.56
And that means that we can
ask the following question:

118.58 --> 120.4
If we drew a shape around the nucleus

120.42 --> 122.46
such that we would be 95% sure

122.49 --> 125.5
of finding a given electron
within that shape,

125.52 --> 127.07
what would it look like?

128.59 --> 130.8
Here are a few of these shapes.

130.82 --> 132.54
Chemists call them orbitals,

132.57 --> 133.9
and what each one looks like

133.93 --> 135.84
depends on, among other things,

135.87 --> 137.69
how much energy it has.

137.72 --> 139.34
The more energy an orbital has,

139.37 --> 141.02
the farther most of its density is

141.04 --> 142.27
from the nucleus.

142.29 --> 145.25
By they way, why did we pick 95%

145.28 --> 146.89
and not 100%?

146.91 --> 148.19
Well, that's another quirk

148.22 --> 149.98
of our model of the electron.

150.0 --> 152.2
Past a certain distance from the nucleus,

152.23 --> 154.05
the probability of finding an electron

154.07 --> 155.6
starts to decrease

155.62 --> 157.91
more or less exponentially,

157.94 --> 160.13
which means that while it
will approach zero,

160.16 --> 162.58
it'll never actually hit zero.

163.12 --> 164.27
So, in every atom,

164.3 --> 167.41
there is some small,
but non-zero, probability

167.44 --> 170.53
that for a very, very
short period of time,

170.55 --> 171.71
one of its electrons

171.73 --> 174.97
is at the other end of the known universe.

175.97 --> 178.69
But mostly electrons stay
close to their nucleus

178.72 --> 180.54
as clouds of negative charged density

180.56 --> 182.66
that shift and move with time.

182.68 --> 184.39
How electrons from one atom

184.41 --> 186.41
interact with electrons from another

186.44 --> 188.76
determines almost everything.

188.78 --> 190.55
Atoms can give up their electrons,

190.57 --> 192.22
surrendering them to other atoms,

192.24 --> 194.62
or they can share electrons.

195.2 --> 197.06
And the dynamics of this social network

197.08 --> 199.53
are what make chemistry interesting.

199.55 --> 200.79
From plain old rocks

200.81 --> 202.6
to the beautiful complexity of life,

202.62 --> 204.36
the nature of everything we see,

204.38 --> 205.9
hear,

205.92 --> 208.11
smell, taste, touch, and even feel

208.14 --> 210.97
is determined at the atomic level.
